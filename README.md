The Azure AI Speech service transcribes speech into text, and text into audible speech. You might use AI Speech to create an application that can transcribe meeting notes or generate text from the recording of interviews. In this exercise, you will try out the capabilities of Azure AI Speech using Azure AI Speech Studio.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that deals with written and spoken language. You can use NLP to build solutions that extract semantic meaning from text or speech, or that formulate meaningful responses in natural language.

For example, suppose the fictitious travel agent Margieâ€™s Travel encourages customers to submit reviews for hotel stays. You could use the Language service to identify key phrases, determine which reviews are positive and which are negative, or analyze the review text for mentions of known entities such as locations or people.

Azure AI Language Service includes text analysis and NLP capabilities. These include the identification of key phrases in text, and the classification of text based on sentiment.
